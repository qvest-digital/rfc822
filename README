└────────────────────────────────┘

The purpose of this library is primarily to enable users to verify
eMail addresses, which cannot be done with a regular expression.
More eMail-related parsers, validators, emitters, etc. later.

Preliminary release note
────────────────────────

The first version of this library has a tight deadline. As such,
it only parses address/mailbox lists and their dependents and can
validate, using eMail rules, localparts and domains (IP address or
FQDN, also usable separately). While comments are parsed, they are
not retained in the parser return structures nor is the whitespace
used. A later version should be able to parse “human-friendly” as
well (that is, if normal parsing fails it should accept semicolons
as list separators, obs-display-name, perhaps even accept arbitrary
string + angle-addr, MIME-encoding for display-name).

Installation
────────────

Add a suitable dependency to your project, for example with Maven:

<dependency>
	<groupId>org.evolvis.tartools</groupId>
	<artifactId>rfc822</artifactId>
	<version>0.1</version>
</dependency>

Make sure your project can handle Java 8 bytecode.
