Runs of FWS, comment, or CFWS that occur between lexical tokens in a
structured header field are semantically interpreted as a single
space character.

   dot-atom-text   =   1*atext *("." 1*atext)
   dot-atom        =   [CFWS] dot-atom-text [CFWS]

Semantically, the optional
comments and FWS surrounding the rest of the characters are not part
of the atom; the atom is only the run of atext characters in an atom,
or the atext and "." characters in a dot-atom.

                       [CFWS]

Semantically, neither the optional CFWS outside of the quote
characters nor the quote characters themselves are part of the
quoted-string; the quoted-string is what is contained between the two
quote characters.  As stated earlier, the "\" in any quoted-pair and

[addr-spec] If the
string can be represented as a dot-atom (that is, it contains no
characters other than atext characters or "." surrounded by atext
characters), then the dot-atom form SHOULD be used and the quoted-
string form SHOULD NOT be used.  Comments and folding white space
SHOULD NOT be used around the "@" in the addr-spec.

      Note: A liberal syntax for the domain portion of addr-spec is
      given here.  However, the domain portion contains addressing
      information specified by and used in other protocols (e.g.,
      [[252]RFC1034], [[253]RFC1035], [[254]RFC1123], [[255]RFC5321]).  It is therefore
      incumbent upon implementations to conform to the syntax of
      addresses for the context in which they are used.

   addr-spec       =   local-part "@" domain
   local-part      =   dot-atom / quoted-string / obs-local-part
   domain          =   dot-atom / domain-literal / obs-domain
   domain-literal  =   [CFWS] "[" *([FWS] dtext) [FWS] "]" [CFWS]

                       obs-dtext          ;  "[", "]", or "\"
